[00:12.69] か弱い光が指差す先
[00:18.59] Silent haze 霞がちに止まる影
[00:31.09] ぎこちない Innocent calm
[00:40.59] 
[00:37.42] Close my eyes and figure out the vacancy
[00:42.83] Don't know what I wanted or you made me do
[00:49.48] 散り散りに刻む
[00:54.15] 本当の世界で笑えるか？
[00:59.65] 
[01:00.04] Don't you get there? It calls, it calls
[01:05.70] 仰いだ空が色変えるから
[01:11.89] My naked heart can hear echoes, echoes
[01:18.12] 識らず求めた Avidity
[01:25.12] 
[01:38.28] 拙い祈りが織りなす波
[01:44.25] Violent maze 砂にまみれ埋まる足
[01:50.62] 鼓膜に響く in 2 下される
[01:56.11] とめどない Resonant harm
[02:05.61] 
[02:02.52] Plug my ears and figure out the tendency
[02:09.59] You don't know how reckless you are
[02:11.97] You make me blue
[02:15.15] 絶え絶えに噤む
[02:20.35] 本当の思いを拾えるか？
[02:25.85] 
[02:26.01] Don't you get there? It calls, it calls
[02:32.25] 意固地な希望を拓く螺旋の奏
[02:38.40] My rusted heart can hear echoes, echoes
[02:44.08] あの日なくした Avidity
[02:51.58] 
[02:52.46] Whisper your name again
[02:58.88] Then restart it right away
[03:03.44] Oh my bitter color ardor wander
[03:08.18] Gotta feel it undercover
[03:11.02] 行方も知らない
[03:14.52] 
[03:15.65] Don't you get there? It calls, it calls
[03:21.36] 仰いだ空が色を変えるから
[03:27.21] My naked heart can hear echoes, echoes
[03:33.85] 識らず求めた Avidity
[03:40.85] 
[03:42.35] Whisper your name again
[03:48.13] Then restart it right away
[03:53.38] Oh my bitter color ardor wander
[03:57.44] Gotta feel it undercover
[04:00.69] 行方も知らない
[04:03.52] あの日の群青

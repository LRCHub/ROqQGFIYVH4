There's a place that's always open
Like my arms 24 hours a day
Here's a map, where's your destination?
$2.50 is all you'll pay

(The MTA)

Here's your chance to make friends with strangers
Be protected from the rain
They say home is where the heart is
Then my heart is only a ride away

(The MTA)

Like the doors it's heart is open
You can ride no matter what your creed
It keeps you warm when it's cold outside
And air conditioning is free

There's no need to wear your helmet
Or maybe you forgot your chain
Stay from protected from the cars outside
Heartless machines driving in your lane
